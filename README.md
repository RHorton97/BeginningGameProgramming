# BeginningGameProgramming
A repository containing the work I complete whilst studying the book: "Beginning C++ Game Programming" by  Michael Dawson

Each folder contains the work from a particular chapter of the book and will contain at least one game that can be compiled and run
The folders may also include text files which contain notes I have taken whilst working through the book

All executable files were compiled on GalliumOS and may not run on all systems. If you wish to run one of the games from this repository then I recommend downloading the source code and compiling it on your own machine to ensure optimal performance. However this is done at your own risk and I am not liable for any issues that occur as a result of your usage of my code.

All work in this repository is licensed under the MIT License, see the file LICENSE for more information.
